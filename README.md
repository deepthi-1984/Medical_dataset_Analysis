# Medical_dataset_Analysis
# Project Description
This project focuses on three critical datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." Divided into two essential modules, the project commences with meticulous data cleaning, ensuring the data's accuracy and structure. Once the data shines brilliantly, the second module unleashes the power of SQL queries to extract valuable insights.
